Use Stereo Jack "Audion In" to give a stero input to equalizer or karaoke circuit.
Use MIC Jack to connect an external MIC.
Note : In case External MIC is connected, MIC on board will automatically be disconnected from the board.

As mentioned in the article there can be two cases in which you may like to conenct hardware.

Karaoke Circuit

1) Connect Audion in to your audion from PC/Mobile or Mp3 player.
2) Use Jumper SW1 to select whether you need Karaoke Effect or not.

	a) Select A-(D-C) for Karaoke Effect - In this case POT no. PR2 is used to vary the Karaoke effect and POT no. PR1 is used for volume.
	b) Select (A-D)-C for Normal Amplification - In this case output is exactly same as input.This connection should be made if Karaoke feature is not required.
3) Now Connect output from Karaoke Circuit i.e PIN Oppoiste to (D) to L or R channel of the output Stereo Jack.
4) Audio out PION near Capacitor C19 is directly conencted to the second channel.
5) POT PR3 is used to increase and decrease the MIC volume.
		



Kindly follow the step below after making sure that your hardware connection are perfect.

Step 1 - Open Arduino.exe

Step 2- Before begining to write the code ,copy and unzip the two .zip folders in your libraries folder under arduino where all libraries are installed.

Step 2 - Open a new window and Copy and paster Code in file Code.c in this window.


Step 3 - Select Target Board as ESATarduino is your using ESAT-ISP evelopment board from Academy Of Embedded Technology.

Step 4 - Select a COM Port if not available on your omputer or PC please install a virtual COM port software.
Like : HWserial Virtual Serial port for windows 98/xp/7

Step 5 - Uplaod the sotware to board.

Note - Please make sure to close the arduino software each a time change is made in its directory.
